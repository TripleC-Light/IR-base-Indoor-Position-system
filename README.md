## What is IR base Indoor Position system?

This system developed to protect children in school, it was cheaper, easier and more stable than WiFi and Bluetooth indoor positioning, and tested at National United University 4 years ago.
I used IR-LED to be Tag, and the receiver was a small device that installed on headphone jack of smart phone. When user is at school, mall or parking lot, they could use Android APP to know their location and the way of destination. The receiver was only USD 0.6 and could not affect by environment, This system can positioning over hundreds of people at the same time and at same place.
